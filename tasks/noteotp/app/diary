I've learned some useful information about ucucuga after my research today.
Firstly, ucucuga always capture all available mental space in human mind.

Okay, I successfully tried to fix myself after this... I don't want to write
this word again, because this process gives a new power to it. U... Ucu...

I'm continuing my science work about Ucucuga. Now I know it causes problems with
memory, so I'll record anything in my head.

I think, the first system note should be about my name.

My name is... My name is...
%
S... I don't remember my name! Do you understand? I don't know my name!!!

Okay, I should be less worried. Obviously, this information already had written
in some places.

Good luck, I've found it! My name is {{USER}}. I've found it in my old
whitepapers about... WHAT???
%
Note {{RANDOM_N}}:

Unexpectedly, I already had done this project about 5 years ago (from my
documents). But I've forgotten it!..

What number of current try? I hope answer is second...

My research subject is too dangerous, so I'll make a secure notebook for my
notes. Current password is {{FAKE_PASSWORD}}.
%
Ucucuga isn't able to control top-level memories. Towards, I think the one-time-password is
the best solution for my problem, because it be never forgotten.
%
ALERT!!! I talked to the other man today. I'm fully confident about this fact.

He doesn't tell his name (maybe, he doesn't know it, like me). But he told me one
secret. This is one word: ugra_cr... Bolt. Krya.

Mummy. Mummy. Are you my mummy?

I should remember it... I should... ug...

I've discovered one room in my home. I didn't know about it before.

The room was a cabinet with chair, table and board with white carpet on it.

I will open it now... My heart is too quickly. Maybe, I shouldn't do it?
%
One second. Two second... 42 bugs..
%
Oh. My. Ucu.

I've removed carpet from board, and... I found my research about Ucucuga. From 1780!

Don't worry, {{USER}}, don't worry. I'll find a mirror.

*turns on radio*

Dance, Dance, let's go with me!
Ucuc! Cucu! Ucug! Cuga!

Hey, radio, why did music stop?
